# AmbientNoise_Log
A log for calculating ANCC using NoisePy

I am using the package NoisePy (https://github.com/mdenolle/NoisePy)

1. I am finishing running the tutorial (download data/running cc/stacking, etc.)
2. Pre-process my own data (http://ds.iris.edu/gmap/#network=7D&starttime=2018-09-01&endtime=2021-08-01&planet=earth)
   This would result in tons of messy data. Hopefully it would not cost too much time to arrange the dataset
3. Run the CC
