# measure the velocity change

# using CCF 

only LEEP station: since all stations are equipped with the same instrument, 
we don't have to remove instrument repsonse in the first place.

After calculating daily CCF (could potential do daily stacking), it seems that 
CCFs have moderate-to-large differences. Hence, stacking more days is necessary 
to stablize the stacked CCF (say, 30-day stacking). 

# consider output the stacked CCF as SAC files
