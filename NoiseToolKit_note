# Apply IRIS DMC Noise Toolkit 

1. Compute power spectral density (PSD) of station waveform data using customized parameters (Noise Toolkit PDF/PSD package)
2. Compute microseism energy from PSDs at different frequency band (Noise Toolkit Microseism Energy Package)
3. Perform frequency dependent polarization analysis of the waveform data (Noise Toolkit Polarization Analysis package)

# PDF/PSD package: 
It allows users to process waveform data from their local files... 

ntk_computePSD.py - request waveforms and response data for given station(s) using the ObsPy FDSN client OR
to read user's waveform data file (SAC, MSEED, etc. format), and compute PSDs and populate a file-based PSD database

#Microseism Energy (ME) package: 
Microseism Energy (ME) package allows users to conveniently calculate and plot microseism energy temporal
variations in the period band of interest using the available PSD values. 
By default, the package is configured to calculate ME over 1–5 s band, targeting smaller local storms for coastal
stations; 5–10 s for the secondary microseisms, 11–30 s for the primary microseisms. 

ntk_computePower.py - calculates power in each PSD window (by default 1 hour) over selected bin period bands

#Polarization Attributes (POLAR) package: 
ntk_computePolarization.py - calculates polarization parameters for a given station and time window
